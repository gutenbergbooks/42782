<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>AUTOGRAPH OF EDWARD OF LANCASTER, SON OF HENRY VI.</h3>

  <p>In the Museum of Antiquities of Rouen is preserved an original
  document, thus designated, "Lettre d'Edouard, Prince de Galles (1471)."
  It is kept under a glass case, and shown as "an undoubted autograph of
  the Black Prince," according to the testimony of the gentleman who has
  very obligingly placed a transcript of this interesting relic at my
  disposal. It is as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Chers et bons amis, nous avons entendu, que ung nostre homme lige
  subject, natif de nostre pays de Galles, est occupé et détenu es prisons
  de la ville de Diepe, pour la mort d'un homme d'icelle ville, dont pour
  le dict cas autres ont esté exécutez. Et pour ce que nostre dict subject
  estoit clerc, a esté et est encores en suspens, parce qu'il a esté requis
  par les officiers de nostre très cher et aimé cousin l'archevesque de
  Rouen, afin qu'il leur fut rendu, ainsi que de droict; pourquoy nous vous
  prions, que icelui nostre homme et subject vous veuillez bailler et
  delivrer aux gens et officiers de mon dict cousin, sans en ce faire
  difficulté. Et nous vous en saurons un très grant gré, et nous ferez ung
  essingulier plaisir. Car monseigneur le roy de France nous a autorisez
  faire grace en semblable cas que celui de mon dict subject, duquel
  desirons fort la delivrance. Escript à Rouen, le onziesme jour de
  Janvier.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i3">(Signed) <span class="sc">Eduard</span>.</p>
      <p>(Countersigned) <span class="sc">Martin</span>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

</blockquote>

  <p>The error of assigning this signature to Edward the Black Prince is
  sufficiently obvious, and somewhat surprising, since we here have an
  undoubted, and, I believe, <i>unique</i> autograph of Edward of
  Lancaster, Prince of Wales, only son of Henry VI. by Margaret of Anjou.
  He was born at Westminster, October 13th, 1453, and was therefore, in
  January, 1471 (no doubt the true date of the document), in the eighteenth
  year of his age. He had sought refuge from the Yorkists, in France, with
  his mother, ever since the year 1462, and in the preceding July or
  August, 1470, had been affianced to Anne Neville, the youngest daughter
  of the Earl of Warwick. At the period when this <!-- Page 34 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>{34}</span>letter was written at
  Rouen, Margaret of Anjou was meditating the descent into England which
  proved so fatal to herself and son, whose life was taken away with such
  barbarity on the field at Tewksbury, in the month of May following. The
  letter is addressed, apparently, to the magistrates of Rouen or Dieppe,
  to request the liberation of a native of Wales (imprisoned for the crime
  of having slain a man), and his delivery to the officers of the
  Archbishop of Rouen, on the plea of his being a clerk. The prince adds,
  that he was authorised by the King of France (Louis XI.) to grant grace
  in similar cases. As the signature of this unfortunate prince is at
  present quite unknown in the series of English royal autographs, it would
  be very desirable that an accurate fac-simile should be made of it by
  some competent artist; and perhaps the art of photography might in this
  instance be most advantageously and successfully used to obtain a perfect
  copy of the entire document.</p>

<h3>ROBERT BLOOMFIELD.</h3>

  <p>Presuming that some of the many readers of "N. &amp; Q." may feel an
  interest in the author of <i>The Farmer's Boy</i>, whom I knew intimately
  (a sickly-looking, retiring, and meditative man), and have often seen
  trimming his bright little flower-garden fronting his neat cottage in the
  City Road&mdash;a pastry-cook's shop, an apple and oyster stall, and part
  of the Eagle Tavern ("To what base uses," &amp;c.) now occupy its, to me,
  hallowed site,&mdash;I send you a few extracts from his sale catalogue,
  an interesting and a rare document, as a mournful record of a genius as
  original and picturesque, as it was beautiful and holy. His books,
  prints, drawings (215 lots), and furniture (105 lots) were sold in the
  humble house in which he died, at Shefford, Beds, on the 28th and 29th
  May, 1824. The far greater number of his books had been presented to him
  by his friends, viz. the Duke of Grafton (a very liberal contributor),
  Dr. Drake, James Montgomery, Samuel Rogers, Mrs. Barbauld, Richard
  Cumberland, Sir James Bland Burges, Capel Lofft, &amp;c. His autograph
  manuscript of <i>The Farmer's Boy</i>, elegantly bound, was sold for
  14<i>l.</i>; of <i>Rural Tales</i>, boards, for 4<i>l.</i>; of <i>Wild
  Flowers</i>, for 3<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>; of <i>Banks of the Wye</i>, for
  3<i>l.</i>; of <i>May-day with the Muses</i> (imperfect), for ten
  shillings; and <i>Description of the Æolian Harp</i> (he was a maker of
  Æolian harps), for 15<i>s.</i> His few well-executed drawings by
  <i>himself</i> (views of his City Road cottage and garden, &amp;c.)
  produced from 5<i>s.</i> to 18<i>s.</i> each. Among his furniture were "A
  handsome inkstand, presented to him by the celebrated Dr. Jenner" (in
  return for his sweet poem of "Good Tidings"), and the "celebrated oak
  table, which Mr. Bloomfield may be said to have rendered immortal by the
  beautiful and pathetic poem inscribed to it in his <i>Wild Flowers</i>.
  The first was sold for 6<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i>, the second for 14<i>l.</i>
  I am happy in the possession of the <i>original miniature</i> (an
  admirable likeness, and finely painted) of Robert Bloomfield, by Edridge.
  It is the first and most authentic portrait of him that was engraved, and
  prefixed to his poems:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And long as Nature in her simplest guise,</p>
      <p>And virtuous sensibility we prize,</p>
      <p>Of well-earn'd fame no poet shall enjoy</p>
      <p>A fairer tribute than <i>The Farmer's Boy</i>."</p>

<h3>NOTE FOR LONDON TOPOGRAPHERS.</h3>

  <p>I send you a note for London topographers. The charter is dateless,
  but, inasmuch as Walter de Langeton was appointed to the bishopric of
  Coventry and Lichfield in 1295, and Sir John le Bretun was "custos" of
  London 22 to 25 Edw. I., <i>i.e.</i> 1294 to 1297, we may fairly assign
  it to the years 1296 or 1297:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Omnibus Christi fidelibus ad quos presentes litere pervenerint,
  Johannes de Notlee salutem in domino. Noveritis me remisisse, et omnino
  quietum clamasse pro me et heredibus meis, Domino Waltero de Langeton,
  Coventrensi et Lichfeldensi episcopo, heredibus, vel assignatis suis,
  totum jus et clameum quod habui, vel aliquo modo habere potui, in quadam
  placea terre cum pertinenciis in vico Westmonasterio sine ullo
  retenemento, illam videlicet que jacet inter exitum curie et porte domini
  Walteri episcopi supradicti, ex una parte, et tenementum Henrici Coci ex
  altera, et inter altum stratam que ducit de Charryngg versus curiam
  Westmonasterii, ex parte una et tenementum domini Walteri episcopi
  supradicti, ex altera; Ita quod ego predictus Johannes, aut heredes mei,
  sive aliquis nomine nostro nuncquam durante seculo in predicta placea
  terre cum omnibus suis pertinenciis, aliquod jus vel clameum habere,
  exigere, vel vendicare poterimus quoquo modo in perpetuum. In cujus rei
  testimonium, sigillum meum apposui huic scripto. His testibus, Dominis
  Johanne le Bretun tunc custode civitatis Londonii; Roberto de Basingg,

<h3>SERMONS BY PARLIAMENTARY CHAPLAINS.</h3>

  <p>Perhaps there is nothing in ecclesiastical writings more ludicrously
  and rabidly solemn than the sermons preached before "The Honourable House
  of Commons" during the Protectorate, by that warlike race of saints who
  figure so extensively in the <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page35"></a>{35}</span>history of those times. I possess some
  thirty of these, and extract from their pages the following morsels,
  which may be taken as a fair sample of the general strain:</p>

  <p>From</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"'Gemitus Columbæ,' the Mournful Note of the Dove; a Sermon preached,"
  &amp;c.: by John Langley, Min. of West Tuperley in the Countie of
  Southampton. 1644.</p>

  <p>"The oxen were plowing, the asses were feeding beside them ('twas in
  the relation of one of Job's messengers). By the oxen wee are to
  vnderstand the laborious Clergie; by the asses, that were feeding beside
  them, wee may vnderstande the Laity" (!).&mdash;P. 8.</p>

  <p>"The worde set on by the Spirit, as Scanderbags' sworde, by the arme
  of Scanderbags, will make a deepe impression."&mdash;P. 16.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Query, what is the allusion here?</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"We came to the height, shall I saye, of our fever (or frenzie,
  rather), when <i>wee began to catch Dotterills</i>, when wee fell to
  cringing and complimenting in worship, stretching out a wing to their
  wing, a legge to their legge."&mdash;P. 18.</p>

  <p>"Time was when the <i>Dove-cote was searched, the Pistolls were cockt;
  the Bloudie-birdes were skirring about</i>: then the Lord withdrew the
  birds."&mdash;P. 29.</p>

  <p>"When your ginnes and snares <i>catch any of the Bloudie-birdes, dally
  not with them, blood will have blood</i>; contracte not their
  bloude-guiltinesse vpon your owne soules, by an vnwarranted clemencie and
  mildnesse."&mdash;P. 30.</p>

  <p>"(<i>Note.</i>&mdash;The 'Bloudie-birdes,' <i>i. e.</i> the
  cavaliers.)"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>From</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A Peace Offering to God: a Sermon preached," &amp;c., by Stephen
  Marshall, B.D. 1641.</p>

  <p>"Not like tavernes, and alehouses, howses of lewd and debauched
  persons, where <i>Zim and Jim</i> dwels, dolefull creatures, fitt only to
  be agents to Satan."&mdash;P. 50.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I conclude with a rather interesting scrap, which I do not remember to
  have met with elsewhere, from</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Ruine of the Authors and Fomentors of Ciuill Warre; a Sermon,"
  &amp;c., by Samuel Gibson. 1645.</p>

  <p>"There was a good motto written ouer the gates at Yorke, at King James
  the Firste his firste entraunce into that city:</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p class="hg1">'Suavis Victoriæ amor populi.'</p>

  <p><i>i. e.</i> the sweete victorie is the love of the people."&mdash;P.

<h3>A PERSPECTIVE VIEW OF TWELVE POSTAGE-STAMPS.</h3>

  <p>In the advertising sheet of "N. &amp; Q." for December 18, 1852, its
  unartistic readers have the tempting offer placed before them of being
  taught "the art of drawing and copying portraits, views, steel or wood
  engravings, with perfect accuracy, ease, and quickness, <i>in one
  lesson</i>! And when the gentle reader of "N. &amp; Q." has recovered
  from the shock of this startling announcement, he is further instructed
  that, "by sending a stamped directed envelope and twelve postage-stamps,
  the necessary articles will be forwarded with the instructions." Who
  would not, thinks the gentle reader, be a Raphael, a Rubens, or a Claude,
  when the metamorphosis may be effected for twelve postage-stamps? And
  then, delighted with the thought that no expensive residence in Italy, or
  laborious application through long years of study, will be required, but
  that the royal road to art may be traversed by paying the small toll of
  twelve postage-stamps, he forthwith gives them to "Mr. A. B. Cleveland,
  13. Victoria Street, Brighton," and in due course of time Mr. A. B. C.
  forwards him "the necessary articles with the instructions," the former
  of which the gentle reader certainly finds to be "no expensive
  apparatus," but as simple as A, B, C. The articles consist of a small
  piece of black paper, and a small piece of common tissue paper, oiled in
  a manner very offensive to a susceptible nose. The instructions are
  printed, and are prefaced by a paragraph which truly declares them to be
  "most simple:"</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The outlines must be sketched by the following means, and may <i>be
  filled up according to pleasure</i>. In the first place, <i>lay what you
  intend to copy straight before you</i>; then <i>lay over it</i> the
  transparent paper, and you will see the outlines most distinctly; pencil
  them over lightly, taking care to keep the paper in the same position
  until you have finished the outlines; after which, place the paper or
  card you intend the copy to appear on under the black tracing-paper, with
  the black side on it, and on which place the outlines you have previously
  taken, remembering to keep them all straight, and then, by passing a
  piece of wire (or anything brought to a point not sufficient to scratch)
  correctly over the said outlines, you will have an exact impression of
  the original upon the card intended, <i>which must then be filled up</i>.
  I would recommend a portrait <i>for the first attempt</i>, which can be
  done in a few minutes, and you will soon see your success. <i>Of course
  you can ink or paint the copy according to pleasure.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>"Why, of course I can," probably exclaims the now un-gentle reader;
  "of course I can, when I have the ability to do it,&mdash;a consummation
  which I devoutly wish for, and which I am quite as far from as when I was
  weak-minded enough to send my twelve postage-stamps to Mr. A. B. C.; and
  yet that individual encloses me a card along with his nasty oiled paper
  and 'instructions,' which card he has the assurance to head 'scientific!'
  and says, 'the exquisite and beautiful art of drawing landscapes, &amp;c.
  from nature, in true perspective, with perfect accuracy, ease, and
  quickness, taught to the most inexperienced person in <span
  class="sm">ONE</span> <i>lesson</i>.' <!-- Page 36 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>{36}</span></p>

  <p>"I should like to know how I am to lay the landscape straight before
  me, and put my oiled paper on the top of it, and trace its outlines in
  true perspective? I should like also to know, since Mr. A. B. C.
  recommends a portrait for the first attempt, how I am to lay the
  transparent paper over my wife's face, without her nose making a hole in
  the middle of it? It is all very well for Mr. A. B. C. to say that he
  'continues to receive very satisfactory testimonials respecting the <span
  class="sm">RESULT</span> of his instructions, which are remarkable for

  <p>Thus, can I imagine, would the gentle reader soliloquise, on finding
  he had received two worthless bits of paper in return for his investment
  of postage-stamps. My thoughts were somewhat the same; for I, alas! sent
  "twelve postage-stamps," which are now lost to view in the dim
  perspective, and I shall only be too happy to sell Mr. A. B. C. his
  instructions, &amp;c. at half-price. In the mean time, however, I forward
  them for Mr. Editor's inspection.</p>

  <p><i>Coleridge a Prophet.</i>&mdash;Among the political writers of the
  nineteenth century, who has shown such prophetic insight into the sad
  destinies of France as Coleridge? It is the fashion with literary
  sciolists to ignore the genius of this great man. Let the following
  extracts stand as evidences of his profound penetration.</p>

  <p><i>Friend</i>, vol. i. p. 244. (1844):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That man has reflected little on human nature who does not perceive
  that the detestable maxims and correspondent crimes of the existing
  French despotism, have already dimmed the recollections of democratic
  phrenzy in the minds of men; by little and little have drawn off to other
  objects the electric force of the feelings which had massed and upholden
  those recollections; and that a favourable concurrence of occasions is
  alone wanting to awaken the thunder and precipitate the lightning from
  the opposite quarter of the political heaven."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Let the events of 1830 and 1848 speak for themselves as to the
  fulfilment of this forecast.</p>

  <p><i>Biographia Literaria</i>, vol. i. p. 30. (1847), [after a most
  masterly analysis of practical genius]:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"These, in tranquil times, are formed to exhibit a perfect poem in
  palace, or temple, or landscape-garden, &amp;c.... But alas! in times of
  tumult they are the men destined to come forth as the shaping spirit of
  ruin, to destroy the wisdom of ages in order to substitute the fancies of
  a day, and to change kings and kingdoms, as the wind shifts and shapes
  the clouds."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Let the present and the future witness the truth of this insight. We
  have (in Coleridge's words) "lights of admonition and warning;" and we
  may live to repent of our indifference, if they are thrown away upon
  us.</p>

  <p><i>Etymology of Molasses.</i>&mdash;The affinity between the
  orthography of this word in Italian (melássa), Spanish (melaza), and
  French (mélasse), and our pronunciation of it (m<i>e</i>lasses), would
  seem to suggest a common origin. How comes it, then, that we write it
  with an <i>o</i> instead of an <i>e</i>? Walker says it is derived frown
  the Italian "mellazzo" (<i>sic</i>); and some French lexicographers trace
  their "mélasse" from <span title="melas" class="grk"
  >&mu;&#x1F73;&lambda;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span>, with reference to the
  colour; others from <span title="meli" class="grk"
  >&mu;&#x1F73;&lambda;&iota;</span>, in allusion to the taste. But these
  Greek derivations are too recondite for our early sugar manufacturers;
  and the likelihood <!-- Page 37 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page37"></a>{37}</span>is, that they found the word nearer home, in
  some circumstance which had less to do with literary refinement than with
  the refining of sugar.</p>

  <p>There is an expression in French which is identical in spelling with
  this word, namely, "molasse" (softish&mdash;so to speak); and which
  describes the liquidity of molasses, as distinguished from the granulous
  substance of which they are the residue. As our first sugar establishment
  was formed in 1643, in an island (St. Christopher) one half of which was
  then occupied by the French, it is possible that we may have adopted the
  word from them; and this conjecture is supported by the following passage
  in Père Labat (vol. iii. p. 93.), where he uses the word "molasse" in the
  sense of <i>soft</i>, to describe a species of sugar that had not
  received, or had lost, the proper degree of consistency.</p>

<h3>ROMAN SEPULCHRAL INSCRIPTIONS.</h3>

  <p>In the year 1847 I brought from the Columbaria, near the tomb of
  Scipio Africanus at Rome, a small collection of sepulchral fictile
  vessels, statuettes, &amp;c., in terra cotta. Among these was a small
  figure, resembling the Athenian Hermæ, consisting of a square pillar,
  surmounted by the bust of a female with a peculiar head-dress and close
  curled coiffure. The pillar bears the following inscription:</p>

<p class="ac">"<span title="YST" class="grk">&Upsilon;&Sigma;&Tau;</span><br/>
<span title="RAN" class="grk">&Rho;&Alpha;&Nu;</span><br/>
<span title="S" class="grk">&Sigma;</span><br/>
<span title="ANI" class="grk">&Alpha;&Nu;&Iota;</span><br/>
<span title="KÊT" class="grk">&Kappa;&Eta;&Tau;</span><br/>
<span title="O." class="grk">&Omicron;.</span>"</p>

  <p>&mdash;a translation of which would oblige me much.</p>

  <p>Another, in the form of a small votive altar, bears the heads of the
  "Dii Majores" and their attributes, the thunderbolt, two-pronged spear,
  and trident, and the inscription&mdash;</p>

<p class="ac">"DIIS PROPI<br/>
M HERENNII<br/>
<span class="hid">(i.e. vivantis).</span> VIVNTIS" (<i>i.e.</i> vivantis).</p>

  <p>Of the meaning of this I am by no means certain; and I have searched
  Montfaucon in vain, to discover anything similar.</p>

  <p>A third was a figure of the Egyptian Osiris, exactly resembling in
  every point (save the material) the little mummy-shaped figures in
  bluish-green porcelain, which are found in such numbers in the catacombs
  of Ghizeh and Abousir. As the Columbaria were probably the places of
  sepulture of the freedmen, these various traces of national worship would
  seem to indicate that they were still allowed to retain the deities
  peculiar to the countries from which they came, through their master
  might be of a different faith.</p>

<h3>CHAPEL PLASTER.</h3>

  <p>In North Wilts, between Corsham and Bradford, and close to the meeting
  of five or six roads, there is a well-known public-house, contiguous to
  which is an ancient wayside chapel bearing this peculiar name. Some
  account of the place, with two views of the chapel, is given in the
  <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, February, 1835, page 143. The meaning of the
  word <i>plaster</i> has always been a puzzle to local antiquaries, and no
  satisfactory derivation of it has yet been given. The first and natural
  notion is, that some allusion is made to the material with which it may
  have been coated. But this is improbable, the building being of good
  freestone, not requiring any such external addition. Some have
  interpreted it to be the chapel of the <i>plas-trew</i>, or "woody
  place." But this again is very unlikely; as the place is not only as far
  as possible from being woody now, but can hardly ever have been otherwise
  than what it is. The rock comes close to the surface, and the general
  situation is on a bleak exposed hill, as unfavourable as can be for the
  growth of trees. Leland, indeed, as he rode by, took it for a hermitage,
  and does also say that the country beyond it "begins to be woody." But
  <!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>{38}</span>a
  point of meeting of five or six much frequented roads, a few miles only
  from Bath and other towns, would be an unsuitable spot for a hermit;
  besides which, the country <i>beyond</i> a spot, is not the spot itself.
  Others have thought it may have been built by a person of the name of
  <i>Plaister</i>; one which, though uncommon, is still not entirely
  extinct in the county. Of this, however, there is no evidence.</p>

  <p>A derivation has occurred to me from noticing a slight variety in the
  spelling and statement of the name, as it is given by one of the ancient
  historians of Glastonbury. He calls it "the chapell of <i>playsters</i>,"
  and says that, like one or two houses of a similar kind, it was built for
  the relief and entertainment of <i>pilgrims</i> resorting to the great
  shrine at that monastery. This indeed is the most reasonable and probable
  account of it, as it lies on the direct road between Malmesbury and
  Glastonbury, and the prevailing tradition has always been that such was
  the purpose for which it was used. It is fair to presume that the name
  has some connexion with the use.</p>

  <p>Now, it is well known that pilgrimages were not in all respects very
  painful or self-denying exercises, but that, with the devotional feeling
  in which they took their origin, was combined, in course of time, a
  considerable admixture of joviality and recreation. They were often, in
  short, looked upon as parties for merry-making, by people of every class
  of life, who would leave their business and duties, on pretence of these
  pious expeditions, but really for a holiday, and, as Chaucer himself
  describes it, "to <i>play</i> a pilgrimage." ("The Shipmanne's Tale.")
  Many also were pilgrims by regular profession, as at this day in Italy,
  for the pleasure of an idle gad-about life at other people's expense. May
  not such "play-ers" of pilgrimages have been called, in the vernacular of
  the times, <i>play-sters</i>? The termination <i><span
  class="nw">-ster</span></i>, said to be derived from a Saxon noun, seems
  in our language to signify a <i>habit</i> or <i>constant employment</i>.
  A <i>malt-ster</i> is one whose sole business it is to make malt; a
  <i>tap-ster</i>, one whose duties are confined to the tap; a
  <i>road-ster</i> is a horse exclusively used as a hack; a
  <i>game-ster</i>, the devotee of the gaming-table. From these analogies
  it seems not unreasonable to suppose that the persons who made a constant
  habit of attending these pleasant jaunts to Glastonbury, may have been
  called by the now-forgotten name of <i>play-sters</i>. If so, "the
  chapell of <i>play-sters</i>" becomes nothing more than "the chapel of
  <i>pilgrims</i>," according to the best tradition that we have of it.
  Perhaps some of your readers may have met with the word in this
  sense?</p>

  instance, how was the name of Wales supposed to have been pronounced four
  hundred years ago, or the name Walter? How could two such different
  sounds as <i>U</i> and <i>V</i> now represent, come by the old printers
  both to be denoted by <i>V</i>? And is it supposed that our present mode
  of pronouncing some words is taken from their spelling in books? We see
  this done in foreign names every day by persons who have no means of
  ascertaining the correct pronunciation. Can it have been done extensively
  in the ordinary words of the language? Or can it be possible, that the
  confusion between the printed <i>V</i> and <i>W</i> and <i>U</i> has
  produced the confusion in pronouncing such words now beginning with
  <i>W</i>, which some classes of her Majesty's subjects are said to
  pronounce as if they commenced with <i>V</i>? I ask for information: and
  to know if the question has anywhere been discussed, in which case
  perhaps some one can refer me to it.</p>

  <p><i>"Les Veus du Hairon," or "Le V&oelig;u du Héron."</i>&mdash;Is any
  more known of this curious historical romance than Sainte Palaye tells us
  in the third volume of his <i>Mémoires sur l'Ancienne Chevalerie</i>? He
  gives the original text (I suspect not very correctly) from, he says, a
  MS. in the public library at Berne. It is a poem in old French verse
  (something like Chaucer's English), of about 500 lines, descriptive of a
  series of <i>vows</i>, by which Robert Comte d'Artois, then an exile in
  England, engaged Edward III., his queen and court, to the invasion of
  France:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Dont maint bon chevalier fu jété fort souvin;</p>
      <p>Mainte dame fu vesve, et maint povre orfelin;</p>
      <p>Et maint bon maronier accourchit son termin;</p>
      <p>Et mainte preude femme mise à divers destin;</p>
      <p>Et encore sera, si Jhesus n'i met fin."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The first lines of the poem give the place and date of the
  transaction, "London, September, 1338," in King Edward's "palais
  marbrin." The versification is as strange as the matter. The author has
  taken great pains to collect as many words rhyming together as possible.
  The first twenty-six lines rhyme to "in;" the hundred next to "is;" then
  fifty to "ent," and so on: but the lines have all their rhythm, and some
  are smooth and harmonious. Has any other MS. been discovered? Has it been
  elsewhere printed? Has it been translated into English, or has any
  English author noticed it? If these questions are answered in the
  negative, I would suggest that the Camden, or some such society, would do
  well to reprint it, with a translation, and Sainte Palaye's commentary,
  and whatever additional information can be gathered about it; for
  although it evidently is a <i>romance</i>, it contains many particulars
  of the court of England, and of the manners of the time, which are
  extremely curious, and which must have a good deal of truth mixed up with
  the chivalrous fable.</p>

<h3>DESCENT OF THE QUEEN FROM JOHN OF GAUNT.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 432.)</p>

  <p>I have in my possession a pedigree, compiled from original sources,
  which will, I believe, fully support your correspondent's opinion that
  the year usually assigned for the death of Joan Beaufort's first husband
  (1410) is inaccurate. Two entries on the Patent Rolls respectively of the
  21st and 22d Richard II., as cited in the pedigree, prove that event to
  have taken place before Lord Neville of Raby's creation as Earl of
  Westmoreland; and I am inclined to think that his creation was rather a
  consequence of his exalted alliance than, as the later and falsely
  assigned date would lead one to infer, that his creation preceded his
  marriage by twelve or thirteen years.</p>

  <p>Robert Ferrers son and heir of Robert, first Lord Ferrers of Wemme
  (second son of Robert, third Baron Ferrers of Chartley), and of
  Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of William Boteler of Wemme, was born
  circa 1372, being eight years old at his father's death in 1380
  (<i>Esc.</i>, 4 Ric. II., No. 25.). He married Joan Beaufort, only
  daughter of John Duke of Lancaster by Catharine Swynford, who became the
  duke's third wife, 13th January, 1396; their issue before marriage having
  been made legitimate by a patent read in parliament, and dated 9th
  February, 1397 (<i>Pat.</i>, 20 Ric. II. p. 2. m. 6.). It might almost be
  inferred from the description given to Joan, Lady Ferrers, in the patent
  of legitimation, "dilectæ <i>nobis nobili mulieri Johannæ Beauford,
  domicellæ</i>," that her first husband was not then living. We find,
  however, that she had certainly become the wife of the Lord Neville
  before the 16th of February following, and that Lord Ferrers was then
  dead (<i>Johanne qui fuist femme de Monsieur Robert Ferrers que Dieu
  assoile</i>): <i>Pat.</i>, 21 Ric. II. p. 2. m. 22.; <i>Pat</i>., 22 Ric.
  II. p. 3. m. 23. The Lord Ferrers left by her only two daughters, his
  coheirs, viz. Elizabeth, wife of John, sixth Baron Greystock, and Mary,
  wife of Ralph Neville, a younger son of Ralph, Lord Neville of Raby, by
  his first wife Margaret Stafford. The mistake in ascribing Lord Ferrers'
  death to the year 1410, has probably arisen from that being the year in
  which his mother died, thus recorded in the pedigrees: "Robert Ferrers,
  s. &amp; h. ob<sup>t</sup> <i>vita matris</i>," who (<i>i.e.</i> the
  mother) died 1410 (<i>Esc.</i>, 12 Hen. IV., No. 21.). His widow
  remarried Ralph, Lord Neville of Raby, fourth baron, who was created Earl
  of Westmoreland, 29th September, 1397<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, <!-- Page 42 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>{42}</span>and died 1425. The
  Countess of Westmoreland died 13th November, 1440.</p>

  <p>As regards the Queen's descent from John, Duke of Lancaster, in the
  strictly legitimate line, I may wish to say a word at another time. Allow
  me now, with reference to the same pedigree, to append a Query to this
  Reply: Can any of your learned genealogical readers direct me to the
  authority which may have induced Miss A. Strickland, in her amusing
  <i>Memoirs of the Lives of the English Queens</i>, to give so strenuous a
  denial of Henry VIII.'s queen, Jane Seymour's claim to a royal lineage?
  Miss Strickland writes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Through Margaret Wentworth, the mother of Jane Seymour, a descent
  from the blood-royal of England was claimed, from an intermarriage with a
  Wentworth and a daughter of Hotspur and Lady Elizabeth Mortimer,
  grand-daughter to Lionel, duke of Clarence. This Lady Percy is stated by
  all ancient heralds to have died childless. Few persons, however, dared
  dispute a pedigree with Henry VIII.," &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Lives of the
  Queens of England</i>, by Agnes Strickland, vol. iv. p. 300.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is a question, I conceive, of sufficient historical importance to
  receive a fuller investigation, and fairly to be determined, if
  possible.</p>

  <p>The pedigree shows the following descent:&mdash;Lionel Plantagenet,
  Duke of Clarence, third son of King Edward III. and Philippa of Hainault,
  left by Elizabeth de Burgh (daughter of William de Burgh, Earl of Ulster,
  and Maud Plantagenet, second daughter of Henry, third Earl of Lancaster)
  an only child, Philippa, married to Edmund Mortimer, third Earl of March
  (<i>Esc.</i>, 5 Ric. II., No. 43.). The eldest daughter of Philippa
  Plantagenet by the Earl of March was Elizabeth Mortimer, who married the
  renowned Hotspur, Henry Lord Percy, son and heir apparent of Henry Lord
  Percy, created Earl of Northumberland, 16th July, 1377, K. G. Hotspur was
  slain at the battle of Shrewsbury, 7th September, 1403, <i>v.p.</i> His
  widow experienced the revengeful persecution of King Henry (Rymer, viii.
  334., Oct. 8, 1403), and died, leaving by her said husband one son,
  Henry, who became second Earl of Northumberland, and an only daughter,
  Elizabeth de Percy, who married firstly, John, seventh Lord Clifford of
  Westmoreland, who died 13th March, 1422 (<i>Esc.</i>, 10 Henry V., No.
  37.), and secondly, Ralph Neville, second Earl of Westmoreland
  (<i>Esc.</i>, 15 Hen. VI., No. 55.), by whom she left an only child, Sir
  John Neville, Knight, who died during his father's lifetime, 20th March,
  1451, <i>s.p.</i> (Will proved 30th March, 1451.) Lady Elizabeth de
  Percy, who died in October, 1436, left by her first husband, the Lord
  Clifford, three children: Thomas, eighth Lord Clifford; Henry, her second
  son; and an only daughter, Mary, who became the wife of Sir Philip
  Wentworth, Knight. The Lady Mary Clifford, who must have been born before
  1422 (her father having died in that year), was probably only a few years
  older than her husband Sir Philip, the issue of a marriage which took
  place in June, 1 Henry VI., 1423 (<i>Cott. MSS. Cleop.</i>, F. iv. f.
  15.); she was buried in the church of the Friars Minor at Ipswich, where
  her mother-in-law directed a marble to be laid over her body. Sir
  Philip's father, Roger Wentworth, Esq. (second son of John Wentworth of
  North Elmsal, a scion of the house of Wentworth of the North), had
  married in 1423 Margery Lady de Roos, widow of John Lord de Roos, sole
  daughter and heiress of Elizabeth de Tibetot, or Tiptoft (third daughter
  and co-heir of Robert, Lord de Tibetot), and of Sir Philip le Despenser
  Chivaler (<i>Esc.</i>, 18 Edw. IV., No. 35.). By this marriage came,
  first, Sir Philip Wentworth, Knight, born circa 1424, and married when
  about <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page43"></a>{43}</span>twenty-three years of age, in 1447; he was
  slain in 1461, and attainted of high treason in the parliament held 1
  Edw. IV.; second, Henry Wentworth of Codham, in the county of Essex;
  third, Thomas Wentworth Chaplain; and fourth, Agnes, wife of Sir Robert
  Constable of Flamborough (<i>Harl. MSS.</i>, 1560. 1449-1484, and will of
  Margery, Lady de Roos, proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury,
  28th May, 1478). Sir Philip, about the year 1447, as before stated,
  married the Lady Mary Clifford (<i>Harl. MSS.</i>, 154. and 1484.),
  sister of Thomas Lord Clifford, who was slain at the battle of St.
  Alban's in 1454, and aunt of the Lord Clifford who stabbed the youthful
  Edmund Plantagenet at the battle of Wakefield, and was himself slain and
  attainted in parliament, 1st Edward IV. 1461. The issue of this marriage
  was Sir Henry Wentworth of Nettlestead, in the county of Suffolk, Knight,
  his son and heir (will of Margery, Lady de Roos, proved as above), born
  circa 1448, being thirty years of age at his grandmother's death in 1478
  (<i>Esc.</i>, 18 Edward IV., No. 35.), and died in 1500. His will was
  proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, 27th February, 1501. Sir
  Henry, son of Sir Philip, was restored in blood by an act of parliament
  passed in the 4th of Edward IV. (<i>Parliament Rolls</i>, v. 548.), and
  having married Anne, daughter of Sir John Say, Knight (<i>Rot. Pat.</i>,
  1 Ric. II., p. 2., No. 86., 20th February, 1484), left by her several
  children, viz. Sir Richard Wentworth, Knight, son and heir, Edward
  Wentworth, and four daughters, the second of whom, Margery, was married
  to Sir John Seymour of Wolf Hall, in the county of Wilts, Knight
  (<i>Harl. MSS.</i>, 1449-1484. 1560., &amp;c.), of which marriage, among
  other children, were born Sir Edward Seymour, created Duke of Somerset,
  and Jane, third wife of King Henry VIII., mother of Edward VI.</p>

  <p>There is amongst the Records of the Duchy of Lancaster an interesting

  soon after her marriage with Lord Neville of Raby. This document, of
  which the following is a translation, proves that Robert Ferrers died
  before 16th February, 1397.</p>

  <p>"John, son of the king of England, Duke of Guienne and of Lancaster,
  Earl of Derby, of Lincoln, and of Leicester, Steward of England, to all
  who these our letters shall see or hear, greeting. Know ye that, of our
  especial grace, and forasmuch as our very loved son, the Lord de Neville,
  and our very loved daughter, Joan, his wife (sa compaigne), who was the
  wife (femme) of Monsieur Robert Ferrers (whom God assoyl), have
  surrendered into our Chancery, to be cancelled, our other letters patent,

  thing to the value thereof, have granted by these presents to the same,
  our son and daughter, all those our lordships, lands, and tenements in

  same, our son and daughter, the manor of Lydell, with appurtenances, to
  have and to hold for their lives, and the life of the survivor, in
  compensation for 40 marks a-year of the abovesaid 500 marks yearly,

  said son and daughter shall answer to us, during such peace as aforesaid,
  for the surplusage of the value of the said manor, beyond the said 40
  marks a-year, and the yearly reprises of the said manor. And in full

  abovesaid son and daughter 206<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> yearly, to
  be received out of the issues of our honours of Pontefract and Pickering,
  by the hands of our receiver there for the time being. In witness whereof
  we have caused these our letters to be made patent. Given under our seal,
  at London, on the 16th day of February, in the twentieth year of the
  reign of our most dread sovereign lord King Richard the Second after the
  Conquest" (<span class="sm">A.D.</span> 1397).</p>

  <p>The above grant was confirmed on the 10th of September, in the
  twenty-second of Richard the Second, 1398, by the eldest son of John of
  Gaunt, Henry of Lancaster, Duke of Hereford, a few weeks only before the
  duke's banishment, in the following words: "We, willing to perform and
  accomplish the good will and desires of our said very honoured lord and
  father, and in the confidence which we have in our said very loved
  brother, now Earl of Westmoreland, that he will be a good and natural son
  to our said very dread lord and father, and that he will be to us in time

  affection which we bear towards our said very loved sister, the countess
  his wife (sa compaigne), do, for us and our heirs, as far as in us lies,

<h3>UNCERTAIN ETYMOLOGIES&mdash;"LEADER."</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 588.)</p>

  <p>I must differ from your correspondent C., in believing that the "N.
  &amp; Q." have effected much good service to etymology. Even the exposure
  of error, and the showing up of crotchets, is of no inconsiderable use. I
  beg to submit that C. himself (unless there are other Richmonds in the
  field) has done good service in this way. See <i>Grummett</i>, <i>Slang
  Phrases</i>, <i>Martinet</i>, <i>Cockade</i>, <i>Romane</i>,
  <i>Covey</i>, <i>Bummaree</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>I do not, indeed, give implicit faith to his <i>Steyne</i>, and some
  more. He, however, would be a rash man who should write or help to write
  a Dictionary of the English language (a desideratum at present) without
  turning over the indices of the "N. &amp; Q." Even in the first volume,
  the discussions on <i>Pokership</i>, <i>Daysman</i>, <i>News</i>, and a
  great many others, seem to me at least valuable contributions to general
  knowledge on etymology.</p>

  <p>As to my remark (Vol. vi., p. 462.) about the derivation of
  <i>leader</i>, C. has, perhaps excusably, for the sake of the pun, done
  me injustice. I hazarded it on the authority of one who has been in the
  trade, and, as I believe, in the <i>cuicunque perito</i>. I beg to
  inclose his own account. He says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is a fact, that when <i>editorial</i> articles are sent to the
  printer, written directions are generally sent with them denoting what
  type is to be used: thus, <i>brevier leads</i>, or <i>bourgeois
  leads</i>, signifying that the articles are to be set in brevier or
  bourgeois type with <i>lead</i> strips between the lines, to keep them
  further asunder. It is also a fact, that such articles are denominated in
  the printing-office 'leaded articles'&mdash;hence, leaders."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I submit if this does not justify my Note. I grant, however, many of
  those articles are entitled also to be called <i>leaden</i>, as C. will
  have it.</p>

  <p>I do not think, however, that in tracing recent words, we should not
  give possible as well as certain origins. Many words, if not a double,
  have at least several putative origins.</p>

  <p>Let me subscribe myself&mdash;<i>seu male seu bene</i>&mdash;</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Nota.</span></p>

  <p>P. S.&mdash;I would like to suggest that this origin of the term
  "leading article" is the most favourable to the modesty of any single
  writer for the Press, who should hardly pretend to <i>lead</i> public
  opinion.</p>

      <p>His cheeks grew thin and wond'rous hairy,</p>
      <p>His visage long, his aspect 'eerie,'</p>
      <p>His <i>tout ensemble</i>, faith, would scare ye,</p>
      <p>Amidst the wilds of Tipperary.</p>
      <p>Becoming hypochon-dri-ary,</p>
      <p>He sent for his apothecary,</p>
      <p>Who ordered 'balm' and 'saponary,'</p>
      <p>Herbs rare to find in Tipperary.</p>
      <p>In his potations ever wary,</p>
      <p>His choicest drink was 'home gooseberry,'</p>
      <p>On 'swipes,' skim-milk, and smallest beer, he</p>
      <p>Scanted rhyme for his Tipperary.</p>
      <p>Had he imbibed good old Madeira,</p>
      <p>Drank 'pottle-deep' of golden sherry,</p>
      <p>Of Falstaff's sack, or ripe canary,</p>
      <p>No rhyme had lack'd for Tipperary.</p>
      <p>Or had his tastes been literary,</p>
      <p>He might have found extemporary,</p>
      <p>Without the aid of dictionary,</p>
      <p>Some fitting rhyme for Tipperary.</p>
      <p>Or had he been an antiquary,</p>
      <p>Burnt 'midnight oil' in his library,</p>
      <p>Or been of temper less 'camsteary,'</p>
      <p>Rhymes had not lack'd for Tipperary.</p>
      <p>He paced about his aviary,</p>
      <p>Blew up, sky-high, his secretary,</p>
      <p>And then in wrath and anger sware he,</p>
      <p>There was <i>no</i> rhyme for Tipperary."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>May we not say with Touchstone, "I'll rhyme you so, eight years
  together; dinners, and suppers, and sleeping hours excepted: it is the
  right butter-woman's rank to market."</p>

<h3>SHAKESPEARE EMENDATIONS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 312.)</p>

  <p>I cannot receive <span class="sc">Mr. Cornish's</span> substitution
  (p. 312.) of "chommer" for <i>clamour</i> in the <i>Winter's Tale</i>,
  Act IV. Sc. 3. In my opinion, <i>clamour</i> is nearly or altogether the
  right word, but wrongly spelt. We have a verb <i>to clam</i>, which, as
  connected with <i>clammy</i>, we use for sticking with glutinous matter;
  but which originally must, like the kindred German <i>klemmen</i>, have
  signified <i>to press</i>, <i>to squeeze</i>; for the kind of wooden vice
  used by harness-makers is, at least in some places, called a
  <i>clams</i>. I therefore suppose the clown to have said <i>clam</i>, or
  perhaps <i>clammer</i> (<i>i.e.</i> hold) <i>your tongues.</i></p>

  <p>Highly plausible as is <span class="sc">Mr. C.'s</span> other
  emendation in the same place of <i>2 Henry IV.</i>, Act III. Sc. 1., I
  cannot receive it either. In Shakspeare the word <i>clown</i> is almost
  always nearly equivalent to the Spanish <i>gracioso</i>, and denotes
  humour; and surely we cannot suppose it to be used of the ship-boy.
  Besides, a verb is wanted, as the causal particle <i>for</i> is as usual
  to be understood before "Uneasy lies," &amp;c. I see no objection
  whatever to the common reading, though <i>possibly</i> the poet
  wrote:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Then, happy <i>boy</i>, lie down."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>There never, in my opinion, was a happier emendation than that of
  <i>guidon</i> for <i>guard</i>; <i>On</i>, in <i>Henry V.</i>, Act IV.
  Sc. 2.; and its being made by two persons independently, gives
  it&mdash;as <span class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> justly observes of
  <i>palpable</i> for <i>capable</i> in <i>As You Like
  It</i>&mdash;additional weight. We are to recollect that a Frenchman is
  the speaker. I find <i>guidon</i> used for banner in the following lines
  of Clément Marot (Elégie III.):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"De Fermeté le grand <i>guidon</i> suivrons,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Cestuy <i>guidon</i> et triomphante enseigne,</p>
      <p>Nous devons suyvre: Amour le nous enseigne."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The change of <i>a sea of troubles</i> to <i>assay of troubles</i> in
  <i>Hamlet</i> is very plausible, and ought perhaps to be received. So
  also is <span class="sc">Sir F. Madden's</span> of <i>face</i> for
  <i>case</i> (which last is downright nonsense) in <i>Twelfth Night</i>,
  Act V. Sc. 1. But I would just hint that as all the rest of the Duke's
  speech is in rhyme, it is not impossible that the poet may have
  written&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"O thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be</p>
      <p>When time hath sow'd a grizzle upon thee?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>{45}</span></p>

  <p>Allow me now to put a question to the critics. In the two concluding
  lines of the <i>Merchant of Venice</i> (the speaker, observe, is the
  jesting Gratiano):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Well, while I live, I'll fear no other thing</p>
      <p>So sore, as keeping safe Nerissa's ring."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>May there not be a covert allusion to the story first told by Poggio
  in his <i>Facetiæ</i>, then by Ariosto, then by Rabelais, then by La
  Fontaine, and, finally, by Prior, in his <i>Hans Carvel</i>? Rabelais was
  greatly read at the time.</p>

<h3>STATUES REPRESENTED ON COINS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 485.)</p>

  <p>Mr. Burgon (<i>Inquiry into the Motive of the Representations on
  Ancient Coins</i>, p. 19.) says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I do not believe that the types of coins are, on any occasion,
  original compositions; but always copied from some sacred public
  monument.... When we find Minerva represented on coins, we are not to
  understand the type as <i>a Minerva</i>, but <i>the Minerva of that
  place</i>; and in some cases which might be brought forward, the
  individual statues which are represented on coins, or ancient copies,
  will be found still to exist."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This opinion is certainly borne out by a very great number of proofs,
  and may almost be considered demonstrated. The Farnese Hercules is found
  on many coins, Roman and Greek. The commonest among the Roman are those
  of Gordianus Pius, 1st and 2nd brass, with "<span class="sm">VIRTVTI
  AVGVSTI</span>." Three colonial coins of Corinth, of Severus, Caracalla,
  and Geta (Vaillant, <i>Num. Imp. Coloniis percuss</i>., ii. 7. 32. 54.),
  exhibit the same figure. As an additional illustration of Mr. Burgon's
  view, I would advert to the Corinthian coin of Aurelius (Vaill. i. 182.),
  which has a Hercules in a different attitude; and which Vaillant regards
  as a copy of the statue mentioned by Pausanias as existing at Corinth. Du
  Choul (<i>Religio vet. Rom.</i>, 1685, pp. 158, 159.) gives a coin
  representing Hercules killing Antæus; and quotes Pliny for a statue
  representing this by Polycletus. Haym also (<i>Tesoro</i>, i. 248.) gives
  a coin with a reversed view of the same subject. The figures of Hercules
  on coins of Commodus are certainly copied from the statues of that
  Emperor. Baudelot de Dairval (<i>De l'Utilité des Voyages</i>) gives a
  small silver statuette of Commodus as Hercules, certainly copied from the
  larger statues, and corresponding with those on coins.</p>

  <p>I am not aware of any coins exhibiting exactly the Venus de Medici. It
  is possible, however, that they exist, though I cannot at present find
  them. Haym (<i>Tesoro</i>, ii. 246., tab. xvi. 3.) gives a coin of
  Cnidus, with a very similar representation, the Cnidian Venus, known to
  be copied from a statue by Praxiteles.</p>

  <p>I must say the same as to the Apollo Belvidere.</p>

  <p>I cannot at present refer to an engraving of the equestrian statue of
  Aurelius, but Mr. Akerman (<i>Descr. Cat.</i>, i. 280. 12. 14., 283. 10.)
  describes gold coins and a medallion of Aurelius, representing him on
  horseback; and I find in the plates appended by De Bie to <i>Augustini
  Antiquatum ex Nummis Dialogi</i>, Antw., 1617, plate 47., one of these
  coins engraved. I find the medallion engraved also by Erizzo (last
  edition, n. d., p. 335.) who explains it as referring to this statue. He
  says, however, that the attribution of the statue was uncertain; and that
  on a medallion of Antoninus Pius, which he possessed, exactly the same
  representation was found, whence he was inclined to suppose it rather
  erected for Antoninus Pius.</p>

  <p>I suppose the coins of Domna, alluded to by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Taylor</span>, are those with the legend "<span class="sm">VENERI
  VICTRICI</span>." In spite of the attitude, I can hardly think this
  intended for Venus Callipyge, from the fact that Venus Victrix is found
  in the same attitude on other coins, holding arms; and sometimes again
  holding arms, but in a different attitude, and more or less clothed. The
  legend is opposed also to this idea. See the coins engraved by Ondaan, or
  Oiselius, Plate <span class="sm">LII.</span> The coin of Plantilla in Du
  Choul (l. c. p. 188.) is a stronger argument; for here is seen a
  partially clothed Venus Victrix, with the same emblems, leaning on a
  shield, as the Venus of Domna leans on a column, but turned towards the
  spectator instead of away: thus demonstrating that no allusion to
  Callipyge is to be seen in either.</p>

  <p>Erizzo (l. c. p. 519.) mentions the discovery at Rome of a fragment of
  a marble statue inscribed "<span class="sm">VENERIS
  VICTRICIS</span>."</p>

  <p>In the British Museum (<i>Townley Gallery</i>, i. 95.) is a bas-relief
  representing the building of the ship Argo. There is described in the
  <i>Thomas Catalogue</i>, p. 22. lot 236., an unpublished (?) medallion of
  Aurelius, possibly copied from this very bas-relief. A very doubtful
  specimen exists in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries, which enables
  me to make this assertion, although it is not minutely described in the
  catalogue, and is otherwise explained. This is an additional confirmation
  of the original statement, and many more might be added but for the
  narrower limits allowed, which I fear I have already transgressed.</p>

<h3>JUDGE JEFFREYS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., pp. 149. 432. 542.)</p>

  <p>This extraordinary and inhuman man was the sixth son of John Jeffreys,
  Esq., of Acton, near Wrexham, co. Denbigh, by Margaret, daughter of Sir
  Thomas Ireland, Knight, of Bewsey, and was born <i>at his father's
  house</i> about the year 1648. <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page46"></a>{46}</span>He died on the 19th of April, 1689, at
  thirty-five minutes past four in the morning. The tradition that his
  remains were deposited at Enfield is incorrect. He was first interred in
  the Tower privately, and after three years, when the day of persecution
  was past, his friends petitioned that they might be allowed to remove the
  coffin. This was granted, and by a warrant dated the 30th of September,
  1692, signed by the queen and directed to the governor of the Tower, the
  body of Lord Jeffreys was removed, and buried a second time in a vault
  under the communion-table of St. Mary, Aldermanbury. As regards the
  number of places pointed out as the residence of Judge Jeffreys, the
  following are mentioned in the bill that was brought in for the
  forfeiture of his honour and estate.</p>

  <p>In Salop he had the manors of Wem and Loppington, with many other
  lands and tenements; in Leicestershire the manors of Dalby and Broughton;
  he bought Dalby of the Duke of Buckingham, and after his death it passed
  to Sir Charles Duncombe, and descended to Anthony Duncombe, afterwards
  Lord Feversham. In Bucks he had the manor of Bulstrode, which he had
  purchased of Sir Roger Hill in 1686, and the manor of Fulmer, with other
  tenements. He built a mansion at Bulstrode, which came afterwards to his
  son-in-law, Charles Dive, who sold it in the reign of Queen Anne, to
  William, Earl of Portland, in whose family, now aggrandised by a dukedom,
  it still continues. And he had an inclination at one time to have become
  the purchaser of another estate (Gunedon Park), but was outwitted by one
  of his legal brethren. Judge Jeffreys held his court in Duke Street,
  Westminster, and made the adjoining houses towards the park his
  residence. These houses were the property of Moses Pitt the bookseller
  (brother of the Western Martyrologist), who, in his <i>Cry of the
  Oppressed</i>, complains very strongly against his tenant, the
  chancellor. Jeffreys's "large house," according to an advertisement in
  the <i>London Gazette</i>, was let to the three Dutch ambassadors who
  came from Holland to congratulate King William upon his accession in
  1689. It was afterwards used for the Admiralty Office, until the middle
  of King William's reign.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The house is easily known," says Pennant, "by a large flight of stone
  steps, which his royal master permitted to be made into the park
  adjacent, for the accommodation of his lordship. These steps terminate
  above in a small court, on three sides of which stands the house."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Edward F. Rimbault.</span></p>

  <p>The birthplace of Judge Jeffreys should not be a matter of doubt. The
  old house at Acton in which his father lived, was in the parish of
  Wrexham, and close to the confines of that parish and Gresford. It was
  pulled down about seventy years ago, about the time when the present
  mansion bearing that same name was built. Twenty years ago there were
  several persons living in the neighbourhood who remembered that it stood
  in the parish of Wrexham.</p>

  <p>Lord Campbell, in his <i>Lives of the Lord Chancellors of England</i>,
  vol. iii. p. 496., writes,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He (Judge Jeffreys) of whom such tales were to be told, was born in
  his father's lowly dwelling at Acton in the year 1648."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And he subjoins the following note:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This is generally given as the year of his birth, but I have tried in
  vain to have it authenticated. There is no entry of his baptism, nor of
  the baptism of his brothers, in the register of Wrexham, the parish in
  which he was born, nor in the adjoining parish of Gresford, in which part
  of the family property lies. I have had accurate researches made in these
  registers by the kindness of my learned friend Serjeant Atcherley, who
  has estates in the neighbourhood. It is not improbable that, in spite of
  the Chancellor's great horror of dissenters, he may have been baptized by
  'a dissenting teacher.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The fact is, however, and it is a fact known certainly twenty years
  ago to several of the inhabitants of Gresford and Wrexham, that no
  register has been preserved in the parish of Wrexham for a period
  extending from 1644 to 1662; and none in the parish of Gresford from 1630
  to 1660. I may add that no such registers have been discovered up to this
  time.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Taffy.</span></p>

  <p>When the family of Jeffreys became possessed of Acton is uncertain,
  probably at a very early period, being descended from Cynric ap
  Rhiwallon, great-grandson of Tudor Trevor.</p>

  <p>George Jeffreys, afterwards Chancellor, was born at Acton, and was
  sixth son of John Jeffreys and Mary, daughter of Sir Thomas Ireland of
  Bewsey, near Warrington, in Lancashire. In 1708 the estate passed into
  the family of the Robinsons of Gwersyllt by the marriage of the eldest
  daughter and heiress of Sir Griffith Jeffreys. Ellis Yonge, Esq., of
  Bryny Orchyn (in the immediate neighbourhood), purchased the estate of
  Acton from the trustees of the said Robinson. The Yonges were in no way
  related to the Jeffreys, although bearing the same arms, as being also
  descended from the same tribe.</p>

<h3>DUTCH ALLEGORICAL PICTURE.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., pp. 458. 590.)</p>

  <p>In answer to the obliging notice which your correspondent <span
  class="sc">Cuthbert Bede</span> (Vol. vi., p. 590.) has taken of my
  description of the Dutch allegorical picture, I beg to say that I agree
  with him, and admit myself to be mistaken in supposing the <!-- Page 47
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>{47}</span>middle picture
  described (Vol. vi., p. 458.) to represent St. John Baptist. On examining
  it again, I have no doubt it is intended to denote the Ascension of our
  Lord. The right hand is raised as in the act of benediction, and, as far
  as I can make it out (for the paint is here somewhat rubbed), the fingers
  are in the position of benediction described by your correspondent. I do
  not, however, concur in his suggestions as to the meaning of the figures
  on the frame of the picture; which is not shaped as a <i>vesica
  piscis</i>, but is (as I described it) a lozenge. The female figure,
  holding a flaming heart, is, I would say, <i>certainly not</i> the Virgin
  Mary.</p>

  <p>The appearance of my account of this picture in your pages has been
  the occasion of a very agreeable correspondence with the Editor of the
  <i>Navorscher</i> (the Dutch daughter of "N. &amp; Q."). That gentleman
  has taken a great interest in the subject, and has enabled me to decypher
  the mottoes on the scrolls which run across the three pictures on the
  right-hand wall of the room, which, in my former communication, I said I
  was unable to read.</p>

  <p>The scroll on the picture nearest the fireplace contains these
  words:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Trouw moet blÿcken."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>That on the second picture, noticed by <span class="sc">Cuthbert
  Bede</span>, is,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Liefde boven al."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And the scroll on the third bears the inscription, as I stated in my
  former communication,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"In Liefd' getrouwe;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>for so it ought to have been printed.</p>

  <p>These, as the editor of the <i>Navorscher</i> informs me, are the
  mottoes of three Haarlem Societies of Rhetoricians called, 1. "De
  Pelicaen," whose motto was, "<i>Trouw moet blÿcken</i>:" 2. "De
  Wyngaertrancken," whose motto was, "<i>Liefde boven al</i>:" and, 3.
  "Witte Angiren," whose device was, "<i>In Liefde getrouwe</i>."</p>

  <p>I think you are entitled to have whatever information I may glean
  respecting this picture, as you so kindly inserted my description of it
  in your columns; and I have to thank you for procuring me the
  acquaintance and correspondence of the editor of the
  <i>Navorscher</i>.</p>

<h3>THE REPRINT, IN 1808, OF THE FIRST FOLIO EDITION OF SHAKSPEARE.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., p. 579.)</p>

  <p>In reply to the Query of <span class="sc">Varro</span>, I beg to state
  that I possess the late Mr. Upcott's collation of the reprint of the
  first folio edition of Shakspeare. It consists of twenty-six folio
  leaves, exclusive of the fly-leaves, on the first of which occur the
  following notes in the handwriting of the collator:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"London Institution,</p>
      <p class="hg3">"Moorfields, Dec. 25, 1821.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"Four months and twenty-three days were occupied, during my leisure
  moments, at the suggestion of our late Librarian, Professor Porson, in
  reading and comparing the <i>pretended</i> reprinted fac-simile
  <i>First</i> Edition of Shakspeare with the original First Edition of
  1623. With what <i>accuracy</i> it passed through the Press, the
  following pages, noticing 368 typographical errors, will sufficiently
  show.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Wm. Upcott.</span>"</p>

  <p>"MS. note written in Mr. Dawson Turner's transcript of these errors in
  the reprint of Shakspeare, edit. 1623.</p>

  <p>"The contents of the following pages are the result of 145 days' close
  attention by a very industrious man. The knowledge of such a task having
  been undertaken and completed, caused some alarm among the booksellers,
  who had expended a considerable sum of money upon the reprint of
  Shakspeare, of which this MS. discloses the numerous errors. Fearful,
  therefore, lest this should be published, they made many overtures for
  the purchase of it, and at length Mr. Upcott was induced to part with it
  to John and Arthur Arch, Cornhill, from whom he expected a handsome
  remuneration; he received a single copy of the reprint, published at five
  guineas.</p>

  <p>"N.B. This copy, <i>corrected</i> by myself from the above MS., I sold
  to James Perry, proprietor of the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, for six
  guineas: which at his sale (Part III.) produced 12<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i>
  6<i>d.</i></p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Wm. Upcott</span>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>At the end of the volume is written:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Finished this collation Jan. 28, 1809, at three minutes past 12
  o'clock.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Wm. Upcott.</span>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Upon comparing these remarks of Mr. Upcott with Lowndes'
  <i>Bibliographer's Manual</i>, p. 1645., col. 1., it will be seen that
  the latter was not accurately informed as to Perry's copy; Professor
  Porson having had no farther share in that laborious work than the
  recommending Mr. Upcott to undertake the collation, from which Perry's
  copy was subsequently corrected.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC NOTES AND QUERIES.</h3>

  <p><i>Le Grey and the Collodion Process.</i>&mdash;As the claim to the
  invention of the collodion process is disputed, I think, in justice to
  <span class="sc">Mr. Le Grey</span>, whom all will acknowledge as a
  talented man, and who has done much for photography, that the claims he
  puts forth, and which I give, should be known to your readers who have
  not got his work, as they are in direct contradiction to <span
  class="sc">Mr. Archer's</span> letter in your 165th No. In his last
  published work, page 89., he states:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I was the first to apply collodion to photography. My first
  experiments were made in 1849. I used that substance then principally to
  give more equality and <!-- Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page48"></a>{48}</span>fineness to the paper. I employed for that
  purpose a solution of iodide of potassium in alcohol of forty degrees
  saturated with collodion.</p>

  <p>"In continuing these studies I was induced to apply this body upon
  glass, to obtain more fineness, and I was soon in possession of an
  extremely rapid proceeding, <i>which I at last consigned to the pamphlet
  that I published in 1850, and which was translated into English at the
  same time</i>.</p>

  <p>"I had already at that time indicated the protosulphate of iron for
  developing the image, the ammonia and the fluorides as accelerating
  agents; and I was the first to announce having obtained by these means
  portraits in five seconds in the shade.</p>

  <p>"The pyro-gallic acid is generally used now in place of the sulphate
  of iron that I had indicated; but this is wrong, that last salt forming
  the image much more rapidly and better, it having to be left less time in
  the camera.</p>

  <p>"I believe, then, I have a right to claim for my country and myself
  the invention of this would-be English process, <i>and of having been the
  first to indicate the collodion, and of giving the best method that has
  been discovered up to the present time</i>.</p>

  <p>"From the publication of my process, till my return from the voyage
  that I had made for the minister, I was little occupied in practising it,
  my labours on the dry paper having taken all my time. This has been used
  as a weapon against me, to make out that the first trials before setting
  out had been quite fruitless, as they had heard nothing more about
  it.</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, I have made my discovery completely public; and if I
  had practised it but little, leaving it to others to further develope, it
  has only been to occupy myself upon other works of which the public has
  still profited. It is then much more ungenerous to wish to take from me
  the merit of its invention."</p>

  <p><i>Ready Mode of iodizing Paper.</i>&mdash;The readiest way I have
  found of iodizing the beautiful paper of Canson Frères, is the
  cyano-iodide of silver, made as follows: Twenty grains of nitrate of
  silver may be placed in half an ounce of distilled water, and half an
  ounce of solution of iodide of potassa, fifty grains to the ounce, added
  to the silver solution. Cyanide of potassa may then be added, drop by
  drop, till the precipitate is dissolved, and the whole filled up with
  four ounces of water. This solution requires but a very few minutes'
  floating upon water containing a small quantity of sulphuric acid; and it
  is then ready, after a bath of nitrate of silver, for the camera, and
  will not present any of the disagreeable spots so noticed by most
  photographers. This paper is probably the best for negative pictures we
  have at present; although, if very transparent paper is required, oiled
  paper may be used for negative pictures very successfully; or paper
  varnished is equally good. The oiled paper may be prepared as follows:
  Take the best walnut oil, that oil having less tendency to darken paper
  of any other kind, and oil it thoroughly. It must then be hung up in the
  light for a few days, the longer the better, till quite dry. It may then
  be iodized with the ammonio-nitrate, the ammoniated solution passing more
  readily over greased surfaces. The varnished paper may be prepared by
  half an ounce of mastic varnish and three ounces of spirits of
  turpentine, hung up to dry, and treated as the oiled paper in iodizing;
  but both are better for resting a short time previous to iodizing upon
  water containing a little isinglass in solution, but used very
  sparingly.</p>

  <p>As I have experienced the excellence of these preparations, I hope
  they may be useful to your photographic students.</p>

  <p><i>After-dilution of Solutions.</i>&mdash;There are in general use two
  methods of preparing sensitive paper. In one, as in Mr. Talbot's, the
  iodide of silver is formed in a state of purity, before being rendered
  sensitive: and as, for this end, a small quantity only of nitrate of
  silver is necessary, a very dilute solution will answer the purpose as
  well, or even better, than a strong one; but by the other method, the
  paper being prepared with iodide of potassium only, or with some other
  analogous salt, the iodide of silver has to be formed by the same
  solution that renders it sensitive. Now as for every 166.3 parts of
  iodide of potassium 170.1 parts of nitrate of silver are required for
  this purpose, it is evident that a dilute solution could not be employed
  unless a very large bulk were taken, and the paper kept in a considerable
  time.</p>

  <p>The after-washing is to remove from the surface of the paper the great
  excess of silver, which is of but little service, and prevents the paper
  from keeping.</p>

  <p><i>Stereoscopic Pictures from one Camera.</i>&mdash;Your correspondent
  <span class="sc">Ramus</span> will easily obtain stereoscopic pictures by
  either of the following plans:&mdash;After the first picture is taken,
  move the subject, as on a pivot, either to the right or left, through an
  angle of about 15°; then take the second impression: this will do very
  well for an inanimate object, as a statue; but, if a portrait is
  required, the camera, after taking the first picture, must be moved
  either to the right or left, a distance of not more than one-fifth of the
  distance it stands from the sitter; that is, if the camera is twenty feet
  from the face of the sitter, the distance between its first and second
  position should not exceed four feet, otherwise the picture will appear
  distorted, and the stereosity unnaturally great. Of course it is
  absolutely necessary in this plan that the sitter do not move his
  position between the taking of the two impressions, and also that the
  distance between him and the camera be the same in both operations. <!--
  Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"></a>{49}</span></p>

  <p>In reply to the very sensible inquiry of <span
  class="sc">Simplicitas</span>, there is an essential difference between
  the calotype of Talbot and the waxed-paper process, the picture in the
  first being almost entirely superficial, whilst in the latter it is much
  more in the body of the paper; this causes the modification of the
  treatment. A <i>tolerably-strong</i> solution of (A<sub>9</sub>O
  NO<sub>5</sub>) nitrate of silver is required to decompose the (KI)
  iodide of potassium, with which the paper is <i>saturated</i>, in any
  reasonable time, but if this were allowed to dry on the surface, stains
  would be the inevitable result; therefore it is floated in distilled
  water, to remove this from the <i>surface</i>; and it seems to me that
  the keeping of the paper depends on the greater or less extent to which
  this surface-coating is removed. There can be no doubt that the paper
  would be far more sensitive, if used immediately, without the washing,
  simply blotting it off; but then the great advantage of the process would
  be lost, viz. its capability of being kept.</p>

<h3>ALLEGED REDUCTION OF ENGLISH SUBJECTS TO SLAVERY.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 510.)</p>

  <p>The crime imputed to the Dutch authorities (that of reducing English
  subjects to slavery) is of so atrocious a character, that any explanation
  that should place the matter in a less offensive light, would be but an
  act of justice to the parties implicated. With this view I venture to
  submit to <span class="sc">Ursula</span> and W. W. the following
  conclusions which I have arrived at, after a careful consideration of all
  the circumstances.</p>

  <p>I am of opinion that the writer of the letter in question (charging
  the Dutch Governor with the above mentioned offence) was the officer
  commanding the troops in the English division of St. Christopher; and, in
  that capacity, invested with the civil government. At that period, the
  <!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page50"></a>{50}</span>administration of our West Indian
  possessions was generally confided to the military commandants: our
  policy, in that respect, being different from that of the French, who
  have contrived at all times to maintain, in each of their colonies, an
  uninterrupted succession of Governors appointed from home.</p>

  <p>The name of the Dutch Governor of St. Martin, to whom the letter was
  addressed, has not been ascertained. He was probably some buccaneering
  chief, who cared as little for the States-General as he did for the
  Governor of St. Christopher. If not actually engaged in the piratical
  enterprises of his countrymen, he certainly had no objection to receive,
  according to usage, the lion's share of the booty as a reward for his
  connivance.</p>

  <p>It is very doubtful whether the outrage imputed, in this instance, to
  the Dutch Governor, was perpetrated, or even attempted. The buccaneers,
  English, French, and Dutch, began by uniting their efforts against the
  Spaniards. After a time they "fell out" (as thieves will sometimes do),
  and, turning from the common enemy, they directed their marauding
  operations against each other. It was doubtless during one of these that
  the Dutch captured the English ship in question; detaining the passengers
  and crew at St. Martin, in the hope of extorting some considerable ransom
  for their release. When, therefore, the English Governor threatened to
  complain to the States-General of the "reduction to slavery of English
  subjects," we must presume that, by the words "reducing to slavery," he
  meant to describe the forcible <i>detention</i> of the passengers and
  crew; and that, in doing so, he merely resorted to the expedient of
  magnifying a common act of piracy into an outrage of a more heinous
  character, with the view of frightening the Dutch authorities into a
  compliance with his wishes, and obtaining the restitution of the property
  and subjects of his "dread Sovereigne Lord y<sup>e</sup> King." The
  annals of that period are replete with similar adventures; and Labat
  relates several of them which he witnessed during a voyage to Guadaloupe
  in a vessel belonging to the French buccaneers. As to the English, the
  daring exploits of Sir Henry Morgan and his followers, and the
  encouragement which they received, both at home and in the colonies, show
  that <i>we</i> were not behind our neighbours in those days of marauding
  notoriety.</p>

  <p>There is another instance in the case of Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne,
  who, having failed in his attempt to exchange his bishopric for some
  canonry or headship at Oxford, applied to the Secretary of State for his

  <p>So extraordinary a petition excited his majesty's curiosity, and
  caused his inquiry from whence it came; when, learning that the person
  was his old acquaintance, Dr. Berkeley, he declared that he should die a
  bishop in spite of himself, but gave him full power to choose his own
  place of residence. This was in 1753.</p>

  has recently recorded, in <!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  clergymen as deputy-lieutenants. This is an office which is so far of a
  military character, that it is supposed to place the holder in the rank
  of lieutenant-colonel, and certainly entitles him to wear a military
  uniform. If these members of the "church militant" should be presented at
  Her Majesty's Court in their new appointment, will they appear in their

  <p><i>Sich House</i> (Vol. vi., pp. 363. 568.).&mdash;<i>Sike</i> or
  <i>syke</i>, a word in common use in the south of Scotland, and on the
  Border, meaning a small water run. In Jamieson's <i>Dictionary</i> it is
  spelt "<i>Sike</i>, <i>syik</i>, <i>syk</i>, a rill or rivulet; one that
  is usually dry in summer; a small stream or rill; a marshy bottom with a
  small stream in it."</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. S.s.</span></p>

  <p><i>Americanisms so called</i> (Vol. vi., p. 554.).&mdash;The word
  <i>bottom</i>, signifying a piece of low ground, whether <i>upon</i> a
  stream of water or not, is English. I recollect two places at this moment
  (both dry), in the county of Surrey, to which the word is applied, viz.
  Smitham Bottom, to the north of Reigate, through which the railway runs;
  and Boxhill Bottom, a few miles to the westward, in the same range of
  chalk hills.</p>

  <p><i>Sparse</i> and <i>sparsely</i>, it is said by <span
  class="sc">Uneda</span> of Philadelphia, <i>are</i> Americanisms. This,
  however, is not so. There is a Query on the word <i>sparse</i> in Vol.
  i., p. 215. by <span class="sc">C. Forbes</span>: and on p. 251. of the
  same volume <span class="sc">J. T. Stanley</span> supposes it to be an
  Americanism, on the authority of the <i>Penny Cyclopædia</i>.</p>

  <p>I have a strong conviction that I then wrote to "N. &amp; Q." to claim
  the word <i>sparse</i> as aboriginal to the British Isles, for I find
  memoranda I had made at the time on the margin of my Jamieson's
  <i>Dictionary</i> on the subject; but I do not find that what I then
  wrote had been printed in "N. &amp; Q."</p>

  <p>In the <i>Supplement to Jamieson's Dictionary</i> is the following:
  "<span class="sc">Spars</span>, <span class="sc">Sparse</span>,
  <i>adj.</i> widely spread; as, 'sparse writing' is wide open writing,
  occupying a large space." The word is in common use throughout the south
  of Scotland.</p>

  <p>I have come to be of opinion that there are few, if any, words that
  are real Americanisms, but that (except where the substance or the
  subject is quite modern) almost every word and expression now in use
  among the Anglo-Americans may be traced to some one of the old provincial
  dialects of the British Isles.</p>

  <p><i>The Folger Family</i> (Vol. vi., p. 583.).&mdash;I do not know

  not quite certain whether they spell it Folger or Fulger, but rather
  think the latter was the mode of spelling it.</p>

  <p><i>Electrical Phenomena</i> (Vol. vi., p. 555.).&mdash;The case
  recorded by <span class="sc">Adsum</span> is not at all an infrequent
  one, and the phenomena alluded to have been noticed for a very long
  period, and are of very common occurrence in dry states of the
  atmosphere. The following, from Daniel's <i>Introduction to Chemical
  Philosophy</i> (a most useful work for general readers), will probably
  explain all that <span class="sc">Adsum</span> is desirous of
  knowing:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It was first observed by Otto de Guericke and Hawsbee, that the
  friction of glass and resinous substances not only produced the phenomena
  which we have just described (those of vitreous and resinous
  electricity), but, under favourable circumstances, was accompanied by a
  rustling or crackling noise; and, when the experiment was made in a dark
  room, by flashes and sparks of light upon their surfaces. When once the
  attention has been directed to the observation, <!-- Page 52 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>{52}</span>most persons will find
  that such phenomena of electrical light are familiar occurrences, and
  often present themselves in suddenly drawing off from the person a silk
  stocking, or a flannel waistcoat, or in the <i>friction of long hair by
  combing</i>. How small a degree of friction is sufficient to excite
  electricity in the human body, is shown in a striking way by placing a
  person upon an insulating stool (with glass legs). If in such a position
  he place his finger upon a gold-leaf electrometer, and another person
  flip him lightly with a silk handkerchief, the leaves will immediately
  repel each other" (resinous electricity has been excited).&mdash;Page

  <p><i>Lord Nelson</i> (Vol. vi., p. 576.).&mdash;I am obliged to <span
  class="sc">Mr. Kersley</span> for giving me an opportunity of reconciling
  my statement respecting Dr. Scott (Vol. vi., p. 438.) with the
  inscription on Mr. Burke's monument. Both, I believe, are true. I quote
  from the <i>Authentic Narrative of the Death of Lord Nelson</i>, by
  William Beatty, M.D. &amp;c. The copy of this work which is before me has
  the following in Sir W. Beatty's own handwriting: "To the Rev. Doctor
  Scott, with every sentiment of regard, by his friend and messmate, the
  author." In this "narrative," Dr. Scott and Mr. Burke are generally
  described as personally attending on Lord Nelson from the time of his
  being brought down into the cockpit. And at p. 50. it is said: "Doctor
  Scott and Mr. Burke, who had all along sustained the bed under his
  shoulders," &amp;c.: and again at p. 51. "His lordship breathed his last
  at thirty minutes past four o'clock: at which period Dr. Scott was in the
  act of rubbing his lordship's breast, and Mr. Burke supporting the bed
  under his shoulders." All this is represented in West's beautiful
  picture, which hangs, in a bad light, in the hall of Greenwich
  Hospital.</p>

  <p>There is another claimant for the honour of having been Nelson's last
  nurse, whose name I forget. His pretensions are recorded on a tablet to
  his memory in the chapel of Greenwich Hospital. Dr. Scott's daughter, who
  was with me there one day, remonstrated on the subject with old blue
  jacket who lionised us. And I put in the lady's right to speak with some
  authority. But "what is writ is writ," was enough for our guide: we could
  make nothing of him, for he fought our arguments as if they had been so
  many guns of the enemy.</p>

  <p>In Clarkson's <i>History of Richmond</i> is a pedigree of the "Wrays,"
  which commences (if I rightly recollect) with an ancestor (six or eight
  years before him) of Sir Christopher Wray, of whose fore-elders, some
  lived at St. Nicholas, near to Richmond.</p>

  <p>I have traced a family of the name of <i>Wray</i> or <i>Wraye</i> for
  three centuries back, in Wensleydale, and at Coverham in Coverdale (both
  in Richmondshire), but am unable to connect it by direct evidence with
  either of the pedigrees above referred to; and should be much obliged for
  any information touching any part of the family in Richmondshire,
  particularly such as might aid in showing the relation of the several
  branches to one another.</p>

  <p>With reference to the origin of the name, I may mention, that there is
  a valley called Raydale, between Wensleydale and Craven, adjacent to
  Coverdale and also a village in Westmoreland, near to the western
  extremity of Wensleydale, called <i>Wray</i> or <i>Ray</i>.</p>

  <p>The arms of the Wensleydale Wrays are: azure, a chevron ermine between
  three helmets proper on a chief or, three martlets gules; crest a
  martlet, and motto "Servabo fidem."</p>

  <p>I am informed that there is to be found, in the Heralds' College, an
  entry of a <i>Wray</i> pedigree with these arms; and I should be glad to
  have particulars of such entry.</p>

  <p>The motto of the St. Nicholas family is, to the best of my
  recollection, "Et juste et vraye:" a canting motto, as is that of</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>We have received a copy of <i>Notes and Emendations on the Text of
  Shakspeare's Plays from Early Manuscript Corrections in a Copy of the
  Folio in the Possession of J. Payne Collier, Esq., F.S.A., forming a
  Supplemental Volume to the Works of Shakspeare, by the same Editor, in
  Eight Volumes, 8vo.</i> With the nature of this volume the readers of "N.
  &amp; Q." are already so fully acquainted, from the frequent references
  which have been made to it in these columns, that on this occasion we
  feel that we need do little more than record its publication, and the
  fact that it appears to be edited with the same scrupulous care, for
  which all works which appeared under the superintendence of Mr. Collier
  are invariably distinguished. That all the critics will agree either with
  the MS. corrections, or with Mr. Collier in his estimate of the value of
  the emendations, is not to be expected; but all will acknowledge that he
  has done good service to Shakspearian literature by their
  publication.</p>

  <p>"The New Year," observes <i>The Athenæum</i>, "opens with some
  announcements of promise in our own literary world. Mr. Bentley announces
  the Memorials and Correspondence of Charles James Fox, on which the late
  Lord Holland was understood to be so long engaged. The work, however, is
  now to be edited by Lord John Russell, and to extend to two volumes
  octavo. The same publisher promises a history, in one large volume, of
  'The Administration of the East India Company,' by Mr. Kaye, author of
  the 'History of the War in Affghanistan;' and a 'History (in two volumes
  octavo) of the Colonial Policy of the British Empire from 1847 to 1851,'
  by the present Earl Grey.&mdash;The fifth and concluding volume of 'The
  Letters of the Earl of Chesterfield,' including some new letters now
  first published from the original MSS., under the editorship, as before,
  of Lord Mahon, will, we believe, shortly appear.&mdash;Two volumes of
  'Letters of the Poet Gray,' so often announced by Mr. Bentley, are to
  come out at last during the present season. They will be edited by the
  Rev. J. Mitford, author of 'The Life of Gray.'&mdash;Nor is Mr. Murray
  without his usual attractive bill of fare for the literary appetite. The
  Lowe Papers, left in a mass of confusion at the death of Sir Harris
  Nicolas, are now nearly ready; and the St. Helena Life of Napoleon will
  appear, it is said, for the first time, as far as Sir Hudson Lowe is
  concerned, in its true light. The Castlereagh Papers (now in Mr. Murray's
  hands) will include matter of moment connected with the Congress of
  Vienna, the Battle of Waterloo, and the occupation of Paris. The same
  publisher announces The Speeches of the Duke of Wellington (to which we
  called attention some time back):&mdash;also a work by Mr. George
  Campbell, called 'India as it may be,'&mdash;and another by Captain
  Elphinstone Erskine about the Western Pacific and Feejee
  Islands.&mdash;The Messrs. Longman announce a Private Life of Daniel
  Webster, by his late Private Secretary, Mr. Charles Lanman&mdash;and a
  new work by Signor Mariotti, 'An Historical Memoir of Fra Dolcino and his
  Times.'&mdash;Mr. Bohn will have ready in a few days 'Yule-Tide Legends,'
  a collection of Scandinavian Tales and Tradition, edited by B. Thorpe,
  Esq.&mdash;Messrs. Hurst and Blackett&mdash;whose names now take the
  place of Mr. Colburn's, as his successors&mdash;are about to publish
  Memoirs of the Court and Cabinets of George the Third, to be compiled
  from original family documents by the Duke of Buckingham and
  Chandos."</p>

  <p>We need scarcely remind the Fellows of the Society of Antiquaries who
  may have in their minds suggestions for the improvement of the Society,
  how desirable it is that they should bring those suggestions at once
  under the consideration of the Committee just appointed. We are sure that
  all such as are submitted to Mr. Hawkins and his colleagues will receive
  every attention; and we trust that the Committee will at once proceed to
  their task, so that the Society may have time to well consider their
  Report before the Anniversary in April.</p>

<h3>Notices to Correspondents.</h3>

  <p><span class="sc">Notices to Correspondents.</span>&mdash;<i>In our
  early Numbers we inserted an address to Correspondents, in which we
  observed, "Correspondents will see, on a very little reflection, that it
  is plainly the Editor's interest to take all he can get, and make the
  most and the best of everything; and therefore he begs them to take for
  granted that their communications are received and appreciated, even if
  the succeeding Numbers bear no proof of it. He is convinced that the want
  of specific acknowledgment will only be felt by those who have no idea of
  the labour and difficulty attendant on the hurried management of such a
  work, and of the impossibility of sometimes giving an explanation, when
  there really is one which would quite satisfy the writer, for the delay
  or non-insertion of his communication. Correspondents in such cases have
  no reason, and, if they understood an Editor's position, they would feel
  that they have no right, to consider themselves undervalued: but nothing
  short of personal experience in editorship would explain to them the
  perplexities and evil consequences arising from the opposite course." We
  have thought well to repeat this general explanation because we have this
  week received two inquiries respecting the non-insertion of
  communications, neither party giving us his name nor the subject of the
  non-inserted communication.</i></p>

  <p>H. H. H.'s (Ashburton) <i>letter has been forwarded to</i> <span
  class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span>. <i>It is not the first by many which we
  have received expressive of the writer's thanks for his valuable
  Photographic Papers.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Alpha</span> <i>complains in so generous a spirit
  that we regret we cannot agree with him. We assure him that, on the first
  point on which he writes, he is the only one who has so written, while we
  have had dozens of letters of thanks; and he will see in the present
  No.</i> (antè, p. 34.) <i>the value of the art recognised by a gentleman
  under whose notice it would probably never have been brought in a purely
  scientific journal. The second suggestion is one to which we, and many of
  our brethren of the Press, have turned our attention frequently, but
  hitherto unsuccessfully. The difficulties are greater than <span
  class="sc">Alpha</span> imagines.</i></p>

  <p><span class="sc">T. W. U. Keye.</span> <i>Will our Correspondent
  favour us with particulars?</i></p>

  <p><span class="sc">Enquirer</span> <i>cannot do better than follow the
  directions for the Paper Process given by</i> <span class="sc">Dr.

  <p>THE PRACTICAL WORKING of THE CHURCH OF SPAIN. By the Rev. FREDERICK
  MEYRICK, M.A., Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Pleasant meadows, happy peasants, all holy monks, all holy priests,
  holy every body. Such charity and such unity, when every man was a
  Catholic. I once believed in this Utopia myself, but when tested by stern
  facts, it all melts away like dream."&mdash;<i>A. Welby Pugin.</i></p>

  <p>"The revelations made by such writers as Mr. Meyrick in Spain and Mr.
  Gladstone in Italy, have at least vindicated for the Church of England a
  providential and morally defined position, mission, and purpose in the
  Catholic Church."&mdash;<i>Morning Chronicle.</i></p>

  <p>"Two valuable works ... to the truthfulness of which we are glad to
  add our own testimony: one, and the most important, is Mr. Meyrick's
  'Practical Working of the Church of Spain.' This is the
  experience&mdash;and it is the experience of every Spanish
  traveller&mdash;of a thoughtful person, as to the lamentable results of
  unchecked Romanism. Here is the solid substantial fact. Spain is divided
  between ultra-infidelity and what is so closely akin to actual idolatry,
  that it can only be controversially, not practically, distinguished from
  it: and over all hangs a lurid cloud of systematic immorality, simply
  frightful to contemplate. We can offer a direct, and even personal,
  testimony to all that Mr. Meyrick has to say."&mdash;<i>Christian
  Remembrancer.</i></p>

  <p>"I wish to recommend it strongly."&mdash;<i>T. K. Arnold's Theological
  Critic.</i></p>

  <p>"Many passing travellers have thrown more or less light upon the state
  of Romanism and Christianity in Spain, according to their objects and
  opportunities; but we suspect these 'workings' are the fullest, the most
  natural, and the most trustworthy, of anything that has appeared upon the
  subject since the time of Blanco White's
  Confessions."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

  <p>"This honest exposition of the practical working of Romanism in Spain,
  of its everyday effects, not its canons and theories, deserves the
  careful study of all, who, unable to test the question abroad, are
  dazzled by the distant mirage with which the Vatican mocks many a
  yearning soul that thirsts after water-brooks pure and
  full."&mdash;<i>Literary Gazette.</i></p>

  <p>ANCIENT IRISH MINSTRELSY, by REV. W. HAMILTON DRUMMOND, D.D.,
  M.R.S.A.</p>

  <p>"A graceful addition to the lover of Ancient Minstrelsy, whether he be
  Irishman or not. A man need not be English to enjoy the Chevy Chace, nor
  Scotch to value the Border Minstrelsy. The extracts we have given from
  Dr. Drummond's work, so full of force and beauty, will satisfy him, we
  trust, he need not be Irish to enjoy the fruits of Dr. D.'s
  labours."&mdash;<i>The Dublin Advocate.</i></p>

  <p>PHOTOGRAPHIC CHEMICALS of absolute Purity, especially prepared for
  this Art, may be procured from R. W. THOMAS, Operative Chemist, 10. Pall
  Mall, whose well-known Preparation of Xylo-Iodide of Silver is pronounced
  by the most eminent scientific men of the day to excel every other
  Photographic Compound in sensitiveness, and in the marvellous vigour
  uniformly preserved in the middle tints of pictures produced by it. MR.
  R. W. THOMAS cautions Photographers against unprincipled persons who
  (from the fact of Xyloidin and Collodion being synonymous terms) would
  lead them to imagine that the inferior compound sold by them at half the
  price is identical with his preparation. In some cases, even the name of
  MR. T.'s Xylo-Iodide of Silver has been assumed. In order to prevent such
  dishonourable practice, each bottle sent from his Establishment is
  stamped with a red label bearing his signature, to counterfeit which is
  felony.</p>

<p class="ac">Prepared solely by R. W. THOMAS,
Chemist, &amp;c., 10. Pall Mall.</p>

  <p>PHOTOGRAPHY.&mdash;Collodion (Iodized with the Ammonio-Iodide of
  Silver).&mdash;J. B. HOCKIN &amp; CO., Chemists, 289. Strand, were the
  first in England who published the application of this agent (see
  <i>Athenæum</i>, Aug. 14th). Their Collodion (price 9<i>d.</i> per oz.)
  retains its extraordinary sensitiveness, tenacity, and colour unimpaired
  for months: it may be exported to any climate, and the Iodizing Compound
  mixed as required. J. B. HOCKIN &amp; CO. manufacture PURE CHEMICALS and
  all APPARATUS with the latest Improvements adapted for all the
  Photographic and Daguerreotype processes. Cameras for Developing in the
  open Country. GLASS BATHS adapted to any Camera. Lenses from the best

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"We can but hope, within the limited space at our disposal, to render
  a scanty and imperfect measure of justice to a work of such vast extent
  and varied erudition.... We would beg the reader, if he be disposed to
  doubt our opinion, to examine almost every single page out of the four
  thousand of which the work consists, in order that he may learn the true
  nature and extent of Mr. O'Donovan's editorial labours. Let him see the
  numberless minute verbal criticisms; the elaborate topographical
  annotations with which each page is loaded; the historical, genealogical,
  and biographical notices; the lucid and ingenious illustrations, drawn
  from the ancient laws, customs, traditions and institutions of Ireland;
  the parallelisms and discrepancies of the narrative with that of other
  annalists, both native and foreign; the countless authorities which are
  examined and adjusted; the errors which are corrected; the omissions and
  deficiencies supplied; in a word, the curious and various learning which
  is everywhere displayed. Let him remember the mines from which all those
  treasures have been drawn are, for the most part, unexplored; that the
  materials thus laudably applied to the illustration of the text are in
  great part manuscripts which Ussher and Ware, even Waddy and Colgen, not
  to speak of Lynch and Lanigan, had never seen, or left unexamined; many
  of them in a language which is to a great extent obsolete."</p>
